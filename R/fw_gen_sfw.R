#' Helper to generate structured model foodwebs
#' 
#' This function is an implementation of the niche model (Williams & Martinez,
#' 2000) which generates food webs based on three elements: 
#'   - a number of species,
#'   - a niche axis and
#'   - a value of connectance.
#'
#' @param nsp An integer giving the number of species considered.
#' @param connec A real positive between 0 and .5 indicating the connectance
#' of the network to be generated.
#' @param connect_all Logical. If `TRUE`, then all species in the network have a
#' least one prey (but the niche with the lowest niche value).
#' @param unbias Logical. If `TRUE`, then the first species may not be a basal 
#' species.
#' @param niche A vector real positive between 0 and 1 standing for the niche 
#' axis. Default is set to `NULL`, in such case the niche axis is automatically 
#' generated.
#'
#' @return 
#' A logical matrix describing pairwise interactions. A given line
#' describes the diet of a given species while a column describes the set of
#' predator associated to a particular species.
#'
#' @details
#' Three remarks. First, according to Williams and Martinez (2000),
#' the species with the lowest niche value is considered as a basal species and
#' therefore cannot feed upon another species. This introduces a slight bias 
#' (\emph{e.g} the expected connectance is lower than the expected values 
#' `connectance`). Second, forcing all the species to be connected introduces 
#' another bias (on connectance values) as they tends to be more connected than 
#' expected. Third, if with custom niche axes, the expected connectance may not
#' be the one expected (`connectance`) as niche values distribution will likely 
#' differs from the uniform distribution used in Williams and Martinez (2000).
